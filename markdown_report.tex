\subsection{Executive summary:}\label{executive-summary}

From what we observed, obtaining the company Electroindex is a good idea
for Blackwell. Both companies are complementary and would benefit for
the high amount of sales from respective diferent products. Accesories
are high on Blackwell's side while Computer are high in Electroindex,
doing cross-selling between the companies would benefit both, therefore,
we recommend to specialize each company in what they sell best and
merge.

\subsection{Introduction:}\label{introduction}

To gather all the neccessery insights about Electroindex's business
activity, we have used their online transactions data and a file
containing all the electronics that they currently sell. Due to their
lack of funding, Electronidex is only able to pull data on the items
that customers purchased per their transactions, meaning that we cannot
identify whether the same customer made multiple transactions during
this time period.

\subsection{Insights and findings:}\label{insights-and-findings}

Using insights from previous analysis of Blackwell's products, we can
see that products that have the highest volume sold are accessories and
displays, which have shown to have a strong association with desktops
and laptops in the Electroindex's data set.

\includegraphics{markdown_report_files/figure-latex/pic1-1.pdf}

We also know that products that have the highest predicted profitability
for Blackwell are Tablets and PCs, shown on the ranked table below:

\includegraphics{markdown_report_files/figure-latex/pic2-1.pdf}

Using product association insights and the above information, we can
conclude that Blackwell can gain profits in the following way if it
decides to buy Electroindex:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Since PCs have the most predicted profit for Blackwell and
  Electroindex's most sold items are PCs, it should use Electroindex's
  products such as PCs/Desktops/Laptops as it's product supply and
  bundle them with already existing Blackwell's accessories.
\item
  Because there is a strong association between accessories and PCs,
  everytime a customer buys a PC, using targeted marketing Blackwell
  could offer bundles or suggestions for customers to also buy
  accessories, which in most cases will provide extra profit.
\end{enumerate}

While doing market basket analysis, we have discovered some strong
associations between Electroindex's products. In particular, a lot of
customers who shop at Electroindex will purchase ``bundles'' of
products, mainly as a combination of desktop/laptop and accessories. We
have also found out that Electroindex's most sold products are desktops
and laptops, which you can see on the graph below:

\subsection{Conclusion:}\label{conclusion}

Using association insights and comparing which types of products both
Blackwell and Electroindex sell, we can conclude that if Blackwell buys
Electroindex, it will benefit the most from selling Electroindex's most
sold items such as PCs/Laptops/Desktops bundled with Blackwell's
accessories supply. Unless Electroindex mainly deals with businesses,
meaning that they have a much larger supply of electronics which might
not be necessery for a company like Blackwell, who mainly deal with non
business customers, the acquisition of Electroindex will bring more
profit in the future. Further discussion is required in order to
understand Blackwell's objectives more clearly, which will make it
easier to decide wether Blackwell should buy Electroindex.
